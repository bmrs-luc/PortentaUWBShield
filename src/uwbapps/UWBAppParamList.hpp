      * In UWB Systems a RFRAME can support different STS Packet profiles (SP).
      * The most relevant ones are SP0, SPI1 and SP3
      *
      *
      * SP0 (STS Packet 0):
      *     The SP0 frame structure is:
      *
      * +-------------------------------------------+
      * |           SP0 RFRAME Structure            |
      * +-------------------------------------------+
      * | Preamble | SFD  | Header | Data Payload   |
      * +-------------------------------------------+
      *
      *     Description: SP0 is a non-secure configuration, meaning it provides
      *     basic ranging functionality without encryption or message authentication.
      *     Components: The RFRAME contains only essential information for ranging,
      *     such as the preamble, synchronization sequence, and basic ranging data.
      *
      *     Use Case: SP0 is used in scenarios where security is not a primary
      *     concern, or where power consumption and simplicity are prioritized,
      *     such as in indoor positioning systems where the environment is
      *     controlled and unauthorized access is unlikely.
      *
      *     Advantages: Minimal overhead due to the absence of security features,
      *     leading to lower power consumption and faster processing.
      *     Disadvantages: Vulnerable to eavesdropping, replay attacks, and
      *     tampering, making it unsuitable for secure applications.
      *
      * SP1 (STS Packet 1):
      *     The SP1 frame structure is:
      *
      * +-----------------------------------------------+
      * |              SP1 RFRAME Structure             |
      * +-----------------------------------------------+
      * | Preamble | SFD | Header | STS  | Data Payload |
      * +-----------------------------------------------+
      *
      *
      *     Description: SP1 provides data integrity and message authentication.
      *     It ensures that messages cannot be easily altered or forged. It
      *     carries a payload
      *
      *
      *     Use Case: SP1 is suitable for applications that perform data
      *     transmission
      *
      *
      * SP3 (STS Packet 3):
      *
      * +-----------------------------------------------------+

      * +-----------------------------------------------------+
      * | Preamble | SFD | STS (Scrambled Timestamp Sequence) |
      * +-----------------------------------------------------+
      *
      *
      *     Description:  the main goal in this profile is to protect the timing
      *     and integrity of the ranging process without necessarily carrying
      *     additional data in the payload. This configuration ensures
      *     confidentiality, integrity, and protection against relay attacks,
      *     focusing solely on secure ranging rather than data transmission.
      *
      *     Use Case: SP3 is used in applications that require high security,
      *     such as financial transactions, sensitive asset tracking, or secure
      *     access control where both confidentiality and integrity are crucial.
      *
      *     Advantages: Provides comprehensive protection against eavesdropping,
      *     tampering, and replay attacks, making it suitable for security-critical
      *     applications.
      *
      *     Disadvantages: Higher processing and power overhead due to encryption
      *     and authentication operations, potentially increasing latency and
      *     reducing battery life in power-sensitive devices.

     //       * requirements for flexibility, efficiency, and collision avoidance, tailored
     //       * to the network density and application needs.
     //       *
     //       * 1. Contention-Based Schedule Mode
     //       *    - Description: Devices operate in an ad hoc manner, initiating ranging
     //       *      sessions as needed without a predefined schedule. Ranging occurs on a
     //       *      first-come-first-served basis, and devices contend for the channel.
     //       *    - Operation:
     //       *      * Each device initiates ranging independently.
     //       *      * If multiple devices range simultaneously, they contend for access,
     //       *        with backoff algorithms managing retries.
     //       *    - Benefits:
     //       *      * Flexibility: On-demand ranging makes this mode adaptable for
     //       *        real-time needs.
     //       *      * Low Overhead: No central schedule management, simplifying setup.
     //       *    - Limitations:
     //       *      * Higher Collision Risk: Greater chance of overlapping transmissions
     //       *        in high-density environments.
     //       *      * Less Predictable Timing: Timing may vary due to backoffs and retries.
     //       *    - Use Cases:
     //       *      * Suitable for low-density environments and user-initiated applications
     //       *        like keyless entry or peer-to-peer ranging.
     //       *
     //       * 2. Time-Based Schedule Mode
     //       *    - Description: Devices use a centrally managed schedule with specific
     //       *      time slots, ensuring only one device ranges at a time. This mode
     //       *      avoids collisions and supports high-density applications.
     //       *    - Operation:
     //       *      * A controller assigns time slots to each device in the network.
     //       *      * Devices range only during their designated slots.
     //       *      * Often uses TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) to prevent collisions.
     //       *    - Benefits:
     //       *      * Collision-Free: Scheduled slots ensure no overlapping transmissions.
     //       *      * Predictable Timing: Structured timing provides reliability and
     //       *        consistency.
     //       *    - Limitations:
     //       *      * Requires Central Coordination: Needs a controller to assign slots,
     //       *        adding setup complexity.
     //       *      * Less Flexible: Immediate, ad hoc ranging is not feasible.
     //       *    - Use Cases:
     //       *      * Ideal for Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) in high-density settings
     //       *        like warehouses, factories, or stadiums.
     //       *
     //       * 3. Hybrid Schedule Mode
     //       *    - Description: Combines elements of Contention-Based and Time-Based
     //       *      modes, mixing centrally managed slots with ad hoc, on-demand ranging.
     //       *      This allows for both flexibility and coordination.
     //       *    - Operation:
     //       *      * Certain slots are scheduled by a controller, while other slots are
     //       *        open for contention-based ranging.
     //       *      * Allows dynamic slot assignment and adjustments based on network needs.
     //       *    - Benefits:
     //       *      * Balanced Flexibility and Coordination: Supports devices requiring
     //       *        scheduled slots while allowing flexibility for others.
     //       *      * Reduced Collision Risk: Scheduled slots reduce contention.
     //       *    - Limitations:
     //       *      * Moderate Complexity: Managing both scheduled and unscheduled slots
     //       *        adds overhead.
     //       *      * Varied Timing Reliability: Contention-based slots may still face
     //       *        collision risks.
     //       *    - Use Cases:
     //       *      * Suitable for environments with mixed-density requirements, such as
     //       *        event venues or smart buildings, where both critical and flexible
     //       *        devices coexist.
